<h3>Harm reduction providers open right now!</h3>

<span>This is a simple webpage with a Google Map that displays the locations of
currently open harm reduction service providers in real time. Information on 
providers comes from <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/consumers/prevention/needles_syringes/docs/sep_hours_sites.pdf"><span>health.ny.gov</span></a>.</span>

<p>The goal of this page is to give addicts (just in the NY 
area for now) easy access to safe paraphernalia, a practice that is proven to
reduce the spread of dangerous diseases like HIV and Hep C. Often times the 
only difference between using "responsibly" and dangerously is easy, immediate
access to clean works. Providers are out there, but some users may not be aware
of just how accessible clean supplies are.</p>
